# Script for generating files

This script will look into names.txt file that contains student's names as "first_name last_name"

The script creates files with the formatted names:
LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_01_hw_117.txt

As a teaching assistant in the IT117 course, I created the script to help my Professor in grading and organizing the students' works.

Later, the created files will be used to contain students' homework 1.
